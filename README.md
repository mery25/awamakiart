## Description
  
  Nowadays there is a huge problem of unconsciuous consumption which has a high impact in our environment and also in our happiness. People buy stuff without any value that they can get from the mall. They don't get to know the workers who had made this goods, besides they are not personalized, just a repetition. And they don't know at all about the labour rights and safety for the worker. 

  This website has two goals:
    - First af all, we want people to be buy in a more conscius way. What if instead of buying a lot of material goods that don't mean anything to you, you buy things with soul. Handmade works made by artisans who do unique works just for you. 

    - On the other hand, we want to give the chance to freelance artisans without finantial help to sell their work for free through this website.
